Submitting assignments
----------------------

In this course we use the web-based Fire system for lab submission.
Any web browser should be usable for submissions.

### Registration

When you first come to Fire, you must register in the system. Follow the
instructions on screen. Your login id in the system is your email address, but
you must also give your name and personnummer, so that we can report your
result when you have finished all your assignments.
Note that an email is sent to you during registration; registration is
completed by following a link included in that mail.
This email address is also used to send you an email when your submissions
have been graded.

After registration, you will come to your Fire home page, where you submit
assignments. On the top of this page you are asked to join a group.
Even if you do your project alone you must create a (one-person) group.
Only groups can submit.

### Submitting

The assignments are linked from your Fire home page.
To submit an assignment, click on the link for that assignment and follow
instructions. Two things should be noted:

* Your solution will include several files, in different directories.
    You must follow the instructions in the lab description on where to
    place files and how to name them.
* Submitting an assignment is a two-step procedure. First, you upload a file
    with your solution: when you click the Upload button, a file chooser
    window is opened allowing you to select a file.
    The second step is to actually submit your solution, by clicking the
    *Submit* button. **It is not enough to only upload; you must also submit!**

[Go to the submission system](\$submissions\$).
